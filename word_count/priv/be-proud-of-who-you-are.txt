I come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows. 
I am who I am, from my head to my toes. 
I tend to get loud when speaking my mind. 
Even a little crazy some of the time. 
I'm not a size 5 and don't care to be. 
You can be you and I can be me. 
I try to stay strong when pain knocks me down. 
And the times that I cry are when no one's around. 
To error is human or so that's what they say. 
Well, tell me who's perfect anyway.
