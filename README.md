# Homework

_Homework_ by [Elixir School](https://github.com/elixirschool) is a collection of coding exercises to be completed in conjunction with our lessons available on [elixirschool.com](https://elixirschool.com).

Each exercise is created as a standalone Mix project requiring a varying degree of code completion to get the include test suite to pass.
